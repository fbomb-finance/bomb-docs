# History

## Launch

The fBOMB token was originally created on March 16th 2021, 11:10pm UTC by an anonymous developer nicknamed 'Bob', who later abandoned the project. The token was very well received upon the Fantom community, as it represented one of their first opportunities to integrate with the ecosystem and be a part of it.

## Death

A few days after the launch, the community, unamused due to Bob's lack of interest on the project, had developed a website for and a lottery dapp for fBOMB. However, when the token's price arose significantly, the original developer took advantage and sold the supply he held, causing a major hit on its price. After this event, the fBOMB community slowly lost momentum.

## Revival

On May 25th 2021, the initial investors of fBOMB and developers gathered together with the goal of reviving the token and making it a relevant project, now with constant development and new leadership. Since then, a new website has been published, a updated lottery and the new decentralized exchange BombSwap, which was responsible for a great growth of BOMB liquidity. Developers are currently working on new features for the ecosystem and enhancing the community's participation through governance. Voting power for governance proposals will solely depend on the user's BOMB balance at a certain given point in time.
