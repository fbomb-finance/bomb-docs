# Shrapnel Token

Shrapnel \(ticket: SHRAP\) is an inflationary token launched along with BombSwap. It was the first token available for trading in the exchange, initially through an IDO \(Initial Dex Offering\). The initial amount of SHRAP minted was 444, which was pooled and then locked until February 2022. It has a max cap of 8888 tokens, and after that, emissions will stop.

Shrapnel can be obtained by farming, using BombSwap liquidity in the Bombing Range section in the app. Emissions are programmed to last two years, and decrease over time.

The token will be used in the future as a fee collector, with fBOMB protocol fees being funneled into the Workshop, also available in the app page.
