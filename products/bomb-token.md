# BOMB Token

The fBOMB token on the Opera blockchain has the exact same, simple tokenomics as its predecessor, BOMB on the Ethereum network: 1% of every transfer's amount is burned forever, effectively creating a naturally deflationary currency. However, due to high fees and consequently low transfer volume, the original token had its purpose defeated. Now, with the aid of the Fantom network, a deflationary currency can prosper and grow: fBOMB, within a few months since deployment, [has burned over 16% of its total supply.](https://ftmscan.com/token/0x8503eb4a136bdbeb323e37aa6e0fa0c772228378)

With the creation of dApps that incentivize liquidity movement, the average burn rate of fBOMB can be raised, increasing its value over time.
