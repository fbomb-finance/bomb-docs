# Minutes to Midnight

Minutes to Midnight is a game in which the last person to buy a 'launch code' wins a majority of the pot that has accumulated throughout the round. For each 100 codes bought, the price rises by 1%.

The code is entirely built from scratch to handle BOMB's deflationary aspect and Fantom Opera's network speed. 

## How to play

First, pick a team. Your team determines two things: 

* where your launch code money goes and if you win
* where the pot winnings go

More information about teams is available below.

Then, just click 'Buy Codes' and choose how many codes you want!  
Sometimes, it's possible that the key's price is increasing too fast. Because of that, your transactions may not work. If you experience this, you can raise the slippage, by setting the value in the slider. This will increase the maximum price you're willing to pay for your codes, as shown in 'Max BOMB Paying'.

Once you're satisfied with your settings, you can hit 'Approve', to unlock your account in the game, and then 'Confirm', to buy the codes.

## Teams

Teams determine both where your launch code money goes and where the pot winnings go if you win.

Take, for example, picking the team Freedonia. The key cost distribution breaks down as follows: 53% of key buys goes to the pot with 41% going to players, 4% going to $SHRAP single side stakers, and 1% goes to dev fees.

#### Code Price Distributions

| Teams | Pot | Players | Shrapnel Stakers | Dev fees |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Fredonia | 54% | 41% | 4% | 1% |
| 81 | 31% | 64% | 4% | 1% |
| 3rd Regiment | 77% | 20% | 2% | 1% |
| Balitan | 49% | 49% | 1% | 1% |

Now all the funds in the pot are also distributed a certain way depending on the winning team. If Freedonia wins, 20% goes into the pot immediately for the next round, 10% goes back to launch code holders \(key holders\) $SHRAP stakers get 20% of the pot and the winner gets 50% of the pot.

#### Final Pot Distributions

| Teams | Winner | Next Pot | Key Holders | Shrapnel Stakers |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Fredonia | 50% | 20% | 10% | 20% |
| 81 | 50% | 30% | 13% | 7% |
| 3rd Regiment | 50% | 40% | 5% | 5% |
| Balitan | 50% | 25% | 23% | 2% |
