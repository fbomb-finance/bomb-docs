# Lottery

The lottery now available at [fbomb.finance](https://fbomb.finance/arcade) gives holders of fBOMB a fun activity and stimulates burning.

The lottery works as follows: For each one of the lotteries, there is a ticket price for entering, and a maximum amount of players. When enough players are in, a random user is chosen and gets the total prize, accumulated from all the BOMB put in.

This works just like the original lottery created by community users in the beginning of our project. Much has happened since then and a new lottery with a special design is being built.

The intent of the fBOMB team is bringing great volume to the Fantom Opera chain through our upcoming products.
