# BombSwap

BombSwap is a decentralized exchange on the Fantom chain. It's reportedly one of the fastest DEXes in the area, and its launch resulted in a significant growth of BOMB liquidity. Now users can trade BOMB with ease, and earn Shrapnel tokens as a reward for providing liquidity.

The TVL \(total value locked\) on the exchange is growing rapidly, as we aim to assist new and promising projects on getting stable and deep liquidity.

Upon launch, the fBOMB team debuted the new SHRAP token, that allows for many new use cases for the project. More information about it is available is the [Shrapnel Token](shrapnel-token.md) page.
